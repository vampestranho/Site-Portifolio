    <br>
<br>I fall asleep in my own tears
<br>I cry for the world, for everyone
<br>And I build a boat to float in
<br>I'm floating away
<br>
<br>I can't recall last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
<br>And I built a cage to hide in
<br>I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
<br>
<br>Let love conquer your mind
<br>Warrior, warrior
<br>Just reach out for the light
<br>Warrior, warrior
<br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
<br>Warrior, warrior
<br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
<br>Warrior, warrior of love
<br>
<br>I stand behind the wall of people and thoughts, mind controlling
<br>And I hold a sword to guide me
<br>I'm fighting my way
<br>
<br>I can't recall last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
<br>And I built a cage to hide in
<br>I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
<br>Ah, ah, ah
<br>
    <br>Let love conquer your mind
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>Just reach out for the light
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
    <br>Warrior, warrior of love

<br>
<br>Underneath darkened skies
<br>There's a light kept alight
<br>
    <br>Let love conquer your mind
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>Just reach out for the light
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
    <br>Warrior, warrior
    <br>I'm a warrior-ior-ior-ior-ior
    <br>Warrior, warrior of love
<br>Warrior of love
<br>Warrior of love
<br>
